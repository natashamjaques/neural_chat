# Neural Chat
[PyTorch 0.4](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) Implementation of Neural Chat: [Approximating Interactive Human Evaluation with Self-Play for Open-Domain Dialog Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.09308). You can interact with the models here: **http://neural.chat**.

This repository is accompanied by [Neural Chat Web](https://github.com/asmadotgh/neural_chat_web) to deploy a web server and host the models online.

This code is inspired by and built off of "A Hierarchical Latent Structure for Variational Conversation Modeling" ([code](https://github.com/ctr4si/A-Hierarchical-Latent-Structure-for-Variational-Conversation-Modeling), [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03424), [presentation](https://vimeo.com/277671819)).

## Prerequisites for running in local machine
This section includes installation of required libraries, and downloading pre-trained models.

### Installation
Install Python packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Setup python path to include repo
```
python setup.py develop
```

### PyTorch Setup
Follow the instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to download PyTorch version (0.4.0) or by running
```bash
pip3 install torch===0.4.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
```

### InferSent Setup

> For more information about InferSent module, see [here](https://github.com/natashamjaques/neural_chat/tree/master/inferSent).

Download [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) [2.18GB] (V1) and the pre-trained InferSent models trained with GloVe.

```bash
mkdir inferSent/dataset/GloVe
curl -Lo inferSent/dataset/GloVe/glove.840B.300d.zip http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.840B.300d.zip
unzip inferSent/dataset/GloVe/glove.840B.300d.zip -d inferSent/dataset/GloVe/
curl -Lo inferSent/encoder/infersent1.pickle https://affect.media.mit.edu/neural_chat/inferSent/encoder/infersent1.pickle
```

You can instead download [fastText](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/english-vectors.html) [5.83GB] (V2) vectors and the corresponding InferSent model. We suggest using GloVe:
```bach
mkdir inferSent/dataset/fastText
curl -Lo inferSent/dataset/fastText/crawl-300d-2M.vec.zip https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/fasttext/vectors-english/crawl-300d-2M-subword.zip
unzip inferSent/dataset/fastText/crawl-300d-2M.vec.zip -d inferSent/dataset/fastText/
curl -Lo inferSent/encoder/infersent2.pickle https://affect.media.mit.edu/neural_chat/inferSent/encoder/infersent2.pickle
```

Note that infersent1 is trained with GloVe (which have been trained on text preprocessed with the PTB tokenizer) and infersent2 is trained with fastText (which have been trained on text preprocessed with the MOSES tokenizer). The latter also removes the padding of zeros with max-pooling which was inconvenient when embedding sentences outside of their batches.

### TorchMoji Setup

> For more information about TorchMoji module, see [here](https://github.com/natashamjaques/neural_chat/tree/master/torchMoji).

Run the download script to downloads the pre-trained torchMoji weights [~85MB] from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/q8lax9ary32c7t9/pytorch_model.bin?dl=0) and put them in the `./torchMoji/model/` directory:
```
python torchMoji/scripts/download_weights.py
```

## Running using Docker

To run the project using docker, check the [corresponding](docker/README.md) file

## Download & Preprocess Data

The following scripts will:

1. Create directories `./datasets/reddit_casual/` and `./datasets/cornell/` respectively.

2. Download and preprocess conversation data inside each directory.

### for [Reddit Casual Conversations Dataset](https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/)

To download the pre-processed dataset [10.31GB], use:
```
python dataset_preprocess.py --dataset=reddit_casual --shortcut
```

Alternatively, if you'd like to download a smaller version [24.2MB], and do pre-processing steps on your end, use:
```
python dataset_preprocess.py --dataset=reddit_casual
    --max_sentence_length (maximum number of words in sentence; default: 30)
    --max_conversation_length (maximum turns of utterances in single conversation; default: 10)
    --max_vocab_size (maximum size of word vocabulary; default: 20000)
    --max_vocab_frequency (minimum frequency of word to be included in vocabulary; default: 5)
    --n_workers (number of workers for multiprocessing; default: os.cpu_count())
```

### for [Cornell Movie Dialogue Dataset](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html)

To download the pre-processed dataset [3.61GB], use:
```
python dataset_preprocess.py --dataset=cornell --shortcut
```

Alternatively, if you'd like to download a smaller version [9.9MB], and do pre-processing steps on your end, use:
```
python dataset_preprocess.py --dataset=reddit_casual
    --max_sentence_length (maximum number of words in sentence; default: 30)
    --max_conversation_length (maximum turns of utterances in single conversation; default: 10)
    --max_vocab_size (maximum size of word vocabulary; default: 20000)
    --max_vocab_frequency (minimum frequency of word to be included in vocabulary; default: 5)
    --n_workers (number of workers for multiprocessing; default: os.cpu_count())
```


## Training EI (Emotion+Infersent) Models
Go to the model directory and set the save_dir in configs.py (this is where the model checkpoints will be saved).

By default, it will save a model checkpoint every epoch to <save_dir> and a tensorboard summary.
For more arguments and options, see config.py.

Note that after training, you should only keep the single optimal checkpoint in the checkpoint directory for
[evaluation](#evaluation) and [interaction](#interacting-with-models) steps and remove the
remaining checkpoints.

We provide our implementation of EI (Emotion+Infersent) models built upon implementations for [VHCR](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03424.pdf), [VHRED](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06069), and [HRED](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02221).

To run training:
```
python train.py --data=<data> --model=<model> --batch_size=<batch_size> [--emotion --infersent]
```

For example:
1. Train HRED-Infersent-only on Cornell Movie:
```
python model/train.py --data=cornell --model=HRED --infersent --infersent_weight=25000 --infersent_embedding_size=128
```

2. Train VHRED-Emotion-only on Reddit Casual Conversations:
```
python model/train.py --data=reddit_casual --model=VHRED --emotion --emo_weight=25 --emo_embedding_size=128
```

3. Train VHCR-EI on Reddit Casual Conversations:
```
python model/train.py --data=reddit_casual --model=VHCR --emotion --infersent --emo_weight=25 --emo_embedding_size=128 --infersent_weight=100000 --infersent_embedding_size=4000
```

## Evaluation

To evaluate the word perplexity:
```
python model/eval.py --mode=<mode> --checkpoint=<path_to_your_checkpoint_directory>
```

For embedding based metrics, you need to download [Google News word vectors](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/edit?usp=sharing), unzip it and put it under the datasets folder.
Then run:
```
python model/eval_embed.py --mode=<mode> --checkpoint=<path_to_your_checkpoint_directory>
```

To evaluate sentiment and semantics using distance from torhcmoji and infersent inferred embedding:
```
python model/eval_novel.py --mode=<mode> --checkpoint=<path_to_your_checkpoint_directory>
```

## Interacting with Models

Use the following command to interact with / talk to a saved model checkpoint:
```
python model/interact.py --debug --checkpoint=<path_to_your_checkpoint_directory>
```
